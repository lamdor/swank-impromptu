* swank-impromptu
  This allows [[http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/][SLIME]] in Emacs to connect to the [[http://impromptu.moso.com.au/][Impromptu]] app
** Instructions
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Impromptu
  ln $WHERE_CHECKED_OUT/swank-impromptu.scm swank-impromptu.scm
#+END_SRC
   1. Checkout and set up the symbolic link
   2. Now when Impromptu starts up, it will also start up a swank server on port 4005
   3. Connect using Emacs via slime-connect in a scheme buffer with the slime-minor-mode
** Caveats
   - Only a minority of swank functions implemented
   - alpha quality, only built so far for my needs
